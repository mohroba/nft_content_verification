# NFT Verification System
This project is a blockchain-based framework that focuses on enhancing the authenticity and credibility of content shared on social networks. Leveraging non-fungible tokens (NFTs), this project provides a solution for evaluating the authenticity of social media content.

## Features
- Implementing ITokens, CTokens, and VTokens for identity, content, and verification management.
- Integration with blockchain technology for decentralized and transparent operations.
- Adaptable for various social media platforms.
